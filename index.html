                <h2>Lasting Impact</h2>
                <p>Marie Curie's groundbreaking research laid the foundation for modern atomic physics and chemistry. Her work on radioactivity opened new frontiers in medicine, leading to treatments for cancer and other diseases. Beyond her scientific contributions, she broke gender barriers in academia and inspired generations of women to pursue careers in science.</p>
                
                <p>Today, the element curium (Cm) is named in honor of Marie and Pierre Curie, and the unit of radioactivity, the curie (Ci), commemorates their pioneering work. Her legacy continues through the Curie Institute in Paris, a leading cancer research center, and through the countless scientists she has inspired.</p>
